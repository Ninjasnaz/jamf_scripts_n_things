# jamf_scripts_n_things

## About
This is a place to store scripts and extension attributes to be used with Jamf Pro (or any other MDM) for managing a fleet of MacOS devices.

The extension attributes collect information such as:

- version of installed application or component (when normal application inventory collection does not capture the desired information)
- licensing status of installed software
- current system or user settings

The scripts perform actions such as:

- installing applications that aren't available in installer packages
- uninstalling applications
- adding or modifying user accounts
- changing user or system settings


## Usage
See [Computer Extension Attributes](http://docs.jamf.com/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Computer_Extension_Attributes.html) and [Running Scripts](http://docs.jamf.com/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Running_Scripts.html) in the **Jamf Pro Administrator's Guide** for instructions on using these resources in your Jamf Pro installation.
